        <p>When Todd and I came to Hawaii on vacation, we stayed in this great condo near everything. It was the time of our lives! We knew we had to stay, so we bought a condo in the same building. For about ten years, we enjoyed our little slice of heaven. As things sometimes go, my parents needed our help and we had to move back to Iowa. So we decided to share our joy and the love of Hawaii with others...by sharing our condo.</p>
        <p>Hawaiian Hale Vacation Rental is in Waikiki, on the island of Oahu. It is a two bedroom condo with a pull out bed in the livingroom - so it can easily sleep up to six people. It is in walking distance to shopping at nearby Royal Hawaiian Center, Waikiki Shopping Center and International Marketplace. If you like to eat out, you are close to so many restaurants. I can't name them all but we recommend Tiki's, Hy's Steakhouse and when you just want a great burger go to Teddy's Bigger Burgers! However, if you don't want to eat out we have a full kitchen and there are grocery stores nearby. If you are looking to visit some of Hawaii's great sites you are near Duke Kahanamoku's statue, the Honolulu Zoo and just a short taxi to Diamond Head. If the beach is what you crave...you are just a couple blocks away from some of the best known beaches in the world. We have all the amenities you would find in a condo. Our gym and pool are open to our guests. The gym has a couple of cardio machines and free weights. The pool is open year-round. </p>

          <p>We stayed in Todd and Jackie's home for our first visit to Hawaii as a family. It was perfect! Just a short walk to the beach and they had everything we could need from beach chairs, towels and even beach toys for the kids! It was great having a kitchen to keep our costs down. It really was a little slice of heaven. We will be back! -- Samantha; Clackamas, OR.</p>

          <p>I stayed in this condo with a group of friends and it was great! Plenty of room and the proximity to everything was amazing. We were able to go out to eat to a different restaurant every meal. It was close to shopping. Everything from high-end to cute Hawaiian shops. I loved that there was a workout area but to be honest, after the first couple of days, I started running on the beach it was so close! <br>-- Debbie Jean; San Francisco, CA</p>
